# Hi, I'm Meagan 👋

I'm a Computer Science + Cybersecurity student at FIU passionate about building meaningful, user-focused solutions. I love working at the intersection of design, development, and strategy — whether that’s designing a full-stack web app, building machine learning models, or exploring ways to create safer systems.

Currently:
- 🛠️ Product Development Intern @ Walky
- 🤖 AI Fellow @ Break Through Tech x Cornell
- 💻 Creator of WiTCON 2024 event website
- 🎓 Expected to graduate FIU in 2026 (BS/MS combined)
